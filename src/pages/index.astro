          Why does my vote count more in certain states?
        </p>
        <p class="font-satoshi font-medium text-[20px] leading-[30px] pt-4">
          Almost every state (except Nebraska and Maine) awards all of their
          electoral college votes to the winner of the popular vote in that
          state. That means if you are a Republican in a very blue state or a
          Democrat in a very red state, your vote is unlikely to change the
          electoral college results — and the electoral college votes are the
          only votes that elect the President.<br /><br />

          Swing states are states where the election is close and a small number
          of votes can swing the election. For example, in 2020, Biden won the
          state of Georgia by a razor-thin margin of just 11,779 votes — and
          there are more than 300,000 college students in Georgia!<br /><br />

          Your vote counts more in a swing state because it might swing the
          election.

          Can I legally register in my home state or school state?

        <p class="font-satoshi font-medium text-[20px] leading-[30px] pt-4">
          Yes, you can register in either state provided that you have a
          long-term intent to live in that state. Registering to vote in a new
          state will typically cancel your registration in any previous state.
          And even though we know you’d never do this, you can’t vote in two
          states.

          Our list of swing states (a.k.a. battleground states) is from the <a

          Some states such as Maine and Nebraska divide their electoral college
          votes into congressional districts. To keep Count More simple (so that
          you can just pick a state rather than type an address), we’ve chosen
          the congressional district with the most competitive rating for that
          state. For example, Maine CD1 is a Solid D (not a swing district) but
          Maine CD2 is a Likely R (swing district). In this case, we consider
          the whole state to be a swing state. If you’d like to see how
          competitive your congressional district is, look at the <a

          There are many other important races on the ballot this November. For
          example, if you live in New York you don’t live in a swing state but
          you might be able to vote on an important House of Representatives
          race on the ballot. To keep Count More simple, we’re only focusing on
          where your vote counts more for the presidential race.

          Are there efforts to change the electoral college?
        </p>
        <p class="font-satoshi font-medium text-[20px] leading-[30px] pt-4">
          We believe each person’s vote should count the same no matter where
          they live. Changing the electoral college is hard because it requires
          a constitutional amendment which must be proposed by a ⅔ majority in
          both the House and the Senate.<br /><br />

          However, there is a way that doesn’t require a constitutional
          amendment. States can join the <a
            href="https://www.nationalpopularvote.com/"

            class="underline cursor-pointer hover:text-hover transition-colors duration-200"
            >National Popular Vote Interstate Compact</a
          > and agree to award their electoral college votes to the winner of the
          national popular vote. The main challenge is that swing states are reluctant
          to sign the compact since they often get special treatment under the current
          system (e.g. more governmental grants).
