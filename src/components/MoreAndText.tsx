            Swing states are states where the election is close and a small
            number of votes can change the outcome. For example, in 2020, Biden
            won the state of Georgia by a razor-thin margin of just 11,779 votes
            — and there are more than 300,000 college students in Georgia!

            Yes, you can register in either state provided that you have a
            long-term intent to live in that state. Registering to vote in a new
            state will typically cancel your registration in any previous state.

            states.
